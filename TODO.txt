TODO

- do set up on vulkan side
- write shader to render basic grass
    write dummy compute shader that just outputs all blades without doing anything to them
    figure out what to do in vertex shader
    figure out how to tessellate bezier curve into grass in tesselation shader
    figure out how to shade grass in fragment shater
- implement gravity for grass
- implement wind for grass
- implement culling optimization


questions
- how to pass 3 points of the bezier curve into vertex shader?
    - vertex shader only handles one vertex right? so do we also pass in an int that clarifies if this is vertex 1 2 or 3?
- RecordComputeCommandBuffer()
    - vkCmdDispatch 1 or 3 threads per grass blades group?
- CreateComputeDescriptorSets()
    - what's the descriptor set for blades's numBladesBuffer?
- CreateGrassDescriptorSets()
    - what layout to use for grass?
