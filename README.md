Introduction
------------
In this project, I use Vulkan to implement a grass simulator and renderer. I use compute shaders to perform physics calculations on Bezier curves that represent individual grass blades. Since rendering every grass blade on every frame is fairly inefficient, I also use compute shaders to cull grass blades that don't contribute to a given frame.

## Grass Rendering

This project is an implementation of the paper, [Responsive Real-Time Grass Rendering for General 3D Scenes](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2017/JAHRMANN-2017-RRTG/JAHRMANN-2017-RRTG-draft.pdf).

### Representing Grass as Bezier Curves

In this project, grass blades are represented as Bezier curves while performing physics calculations and culling operations. 
Each Bezier curve has three control points.
* `v0`: the position of the grass blade on the geomtry
* `v1`: a Bezier curve guide that is always "above" `v0` with respect to the grass blade's up vector (explained soon)
* `v2`: a physical guide for which we simulate forces on

We also store per-blade characteristics that will help us simulate and tessellate our grass blades correctly.
* `up`: the blade's up vector, which corresponds to the normal of the geometry that the grass blade resides on at `v0`
* Orientation: the orientation of the grass blade's face
* Height: the height of the grass blade
* Width: the width of the grass blade's face
* Stiffness coefficient: the stiffness of our grass blade, which will affect the force computations on our blade

We can pack all this data into four `vec4`s, such that `v0.w` holds orientation, `v1.w` holds height, `v2.w` holds width, and 
`up.w` holds the stiffness coefficient.

### Tesselation Shader and Rendering Basic Grass

### Simulating Forces in Compute Shader

* Gravity

Gravity is added in the usual way: `gE = vec3(0, -9.8, 0)`

We determine the contribution of gravity with respect to the front facing direction of the blade, `f`, 
as a term called the "front gravity". Front gravity is computed as `gF = (1/4) * ||gE|| * f`.

The total gravity on the grass blade is `g = gE + gF`.

* Recovery

Recovery corresponds to the counter-force that brings our grass blade back into equilibrium. This is derived in the paper using Hooke's law.

In order to determine the recovery force, we compare the current position of `v2` to its original position before the
simulation started, `iv2`. At the beginning of our simulation, `v1` and `v2` are initialized to be a distance of the blade height along the `up` vector.

Once we have `iv2`, we can compute the recovery forces as `r = (iv2 - v2) * stiffness`.

* Wind

Wind is calculated as `vec(v_x, 0, v_z) * sin(time)`

* Total Force

Total force is calculated as `tF = (gravity + recovery + wind) * deltaTime`. 

* Positional Corrections

I followed section 5.2 of the paper referenced to determine the corrected final positions for `v1` and `v2`. 

### Culling tests

Although we need to simulate forces on every grass blade at every frame, there are many blades that we won't need to render
due to a variety of reasons. Here are some heuristics we can use to cull blades that won't contribute positively to a given frame.

#### Orientation culling

Consider the scenario in which the front face direction of the grass blade is perpendicular to the view vector. Since our grass blades
won't have width, we will end up trying to render parts of the grass that are actually smaller than the size of a pixel. This could
lead to aliasing artifacts.

In order to remedy this, we can cull these blades! Simply do a dot product test to see if the view vector and front face direction of
the blade are perpendicular. The paper uses a threshold value of `0.9` to cull, but feel free to use what you think looks best.

#### View-frustum culling

We also want to cull blades that are outside of the view-frustum, considering they won't show up in the frame anyway. To determine if
a grass blade is in the view-frustum, we want to compare the visibility of three points: `v0, v2, and m`, where `m = (1/4)v0 * (1/2)v1 * (1/4)v2`.
Notice that we aren't using `v1` for the visibility test. This is because the `v1` is a Bezier guide that doesn't represent a position on the grass blade.
We instead use `m` to approximate the midpoint of our Bezier curve.

If all three points are outside of the view-frustum, we will cull the grass blade. The paper uses a tolerance value for this test so that we are culling
blades a little more conservatively. This can help with cases in which the Bezier curve is technically not visible, but we might be able to see the blade
if we consider its width.

#### Distance culling

Similarly to orientation culling, we can end up with grass blades that at large distances are smaller than the size of a pixel. This could lead to additional
artifacts in our renders. In this case, we can cull grass blades as a function of their distance from the camera.

You are free to define two parameters here.
* A max distance afterwhich all grass blades will be culled.
* A number of buckets to place grass blades between the camera and max distance into.

Define a function such that the grass blades in the bucket closest to the camera are kept while an increasing number of grass blades
are culled with each farther bucket.
